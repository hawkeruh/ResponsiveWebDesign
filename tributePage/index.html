                It was with great sadness that I learned of Kim Jung Gi's sudden passing in 2022. An artistic master, 
                <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/kimjunggius/" target="_blank">Kim Jung Gi</a> departed this world 
                at the young age of 47, but already leaving behind a legacy and wonderful works of art.

                It was mesmerizing to watch him draw, capturing perspective, motion and personalities into his characters, objects and whatever he draw, and may I add: Without using outlines!
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">
                It was almost magic, as if he just imprinted what he envisioned in his head without the need of guidelines to correct or references. 
                You can watch it on YouTube, there are several videos (all with thousand of views) of him just drawing away on a mural and people watching just as perplexed mesmerized. 
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">
                Of course, we cannot attribute such talent with magic, in his interviews and conversations it is clearly a product of hard work and passion. 
                He has draw so much and so many times, and master it in a way that at that point in his life outlines were simple not needed anymore.
