                    It was with great sadness that I learned of Kim Jung Gi's sudden passing in 2022. An artistic master, 
                    <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/kimjunggius/" target="_blank">Kim Jung Gi</a> departed this world 
                    at the young age of 47, but already leaving behind a legacy and wonderful works of art.

                <p class="p-text">
                    Watching him draw is a mesmerizing experience, he manages to capture perspective, motion and personalities into his characters, objects and whatever he draw, and may I add:<em> Without using outlines!</em> 
                </p>
                <p class="p-text">
                    It was almost magic, as if he just imprinted what he envisioned in his head without the need of guidelines to correct or references. 
                    You can watch it on YouTube, there are several videos (all with thousand of views) of him just drawing away on a mural and people watching just as perplexed mesmerized. 
                </p>
                <p class="p-text">
                    Of course, we cannot attribute such talent with magic, in his interviews and conversations it is clearly a product of hard work and passion. 
                    He has draw so much and so many times, and master it in a way that at that point in his life outlines were simple not needed anymore.

                    Kim Jung Gi was born in South Korea in March 7, 1975. He developed an early interest in art and pursued his passion by studying Fine Arts at Dong-Eui University in Busan, South Korea.

                <p class="p-text">
                    He primarily drew in ink, has published several comic books including SpyGames, Tiger the Long Tail and McCurry. 
                    And has worked with brands like League Of Legends, Marvel Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment.

                <p class="p-text">
                    But his major success is the Sketch Collection, from 2007, 2011, 2013, 2018 and his last in 2022. 
                    Below you can see some examples of his work. I recommend watching one of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGbvhyTZXfs&pp=ygUMa2ltZyBqdW5nIGdp" target="_blank">showcase live drawing</a>.
