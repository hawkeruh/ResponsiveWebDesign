## Objectives

Made a small gallery with 9 photos and drawings.
The images are responsive to the size of the screen. On the screenshot below you can see three columns, but if you change the size of the window, it can show one to two columns. 

## Screenshots

## Observations

- Images are used with links not to images on folder but to other websites that are hosting and can be broken without notice.
